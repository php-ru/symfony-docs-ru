The Contracts Component
=======================

    The Contracts component provides a set of abstractions extracted out of the
    Symfony components. They can be used to build on semantics that the Symfony
    components proved useful - and that already have battle-tested implementations.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/contracts

.. include:: /components/require_autoload.rst.inc

Usage
-----

The abstractions in this package are useful to achieve loose coupling and
interoperability. By using the provided interfaces as type hints, you are able
to reuse any implementations that match their contracts. It could be a Symfony
component, or another package provided by the PHP community at large.

Depending on their semantics, some interfaces can be combined with
:doc:`autowiring </service_container/autowiring>` to seamlessly inject a service
in your classes.

Others might be useful as labeling interfaces, to hint about a specific behavior
that can be enabled when using :ref:`autoconfiguration <services-autoconfigure>`
or manual :doc:`service tagging </service_container/tags>` (or any other means
provided by your framework.)

Design Principles
-----------------

* Contracts are split by domain, each into their own sub-namespaces;
* Contracts are small and consistent sets of PHP interfaces, traits, normative
  docblocks and reference test suites when applicable, ...;
* Contracts must have a proven implementation to enter this repository;
* Contracts must be backward compatible with existing Symfony components.

Packages that implement specific contracts should list them in the ``provide``
section of their ``composer.json`` file, using the
``symfony/*-contracts-implementation`` convention. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "...": "...",
        "provide": {
            "symfony/cache-contracts-implementation": "1.0"
        }
    }

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

How Is this Different From PHP-FIG's PSRs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When applicable, the provided contracts are built on top of `PHP-FIG`_'s PSRs.
However, PHP-FIG has different goals and different processes. Symfony Contracts
focuses  on providing abstractions that are useful on their own while still
compatible with implementations provided by Symfony.

Why Isn't this Package Split into Several Packages?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Putting all interfaces in one package eases discoverability and dependency
management. Instead of dealing with a myriad of small packages and the
corresponding matrix of versions, you only deal with one package and one
version. Also when using IDE autocompletion or reading the source code, it makes
it easier to figure out which contracts are provided.

There are two downsides to this approach:

* You may have unused files in your ``vendor/`` directory. This has no impact in
  practice because the file sizes are very small and there is no performance
  overhead at all since they are never loaded.
* In the future, it will be impossible to use two different sub-namespaces in
  different major versions of the package. However, this package follows the
  :doc:`Symfony BC + deprecation </contributing/code/bc>` policies, with an
  additional restriction to never remove deprecated interfaces.
