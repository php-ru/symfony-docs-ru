disabled
~~~~~~~~

**type**: ``boolean``  **default**: ``false``

If you don't want a user to be able to click a button, you can set the disabled
option to true. It will not be possible to submit the form with this button,
not even when bypassing the browser and sending a request manually, for
example with cURL.
