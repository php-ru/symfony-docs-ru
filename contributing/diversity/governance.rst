Diversity Initiative Governance
===============================

Membership
----------

Membership of Symfony's Diversity Initiative is open to any member of the
Symfony community; to avoid the risk of elitism or meritocracy, no requirement
is needed to be involved. All members, at any time, are invited to put forward
ideas and suggestions as a proposal for an actionable item.

Guidance
--------

The project leader, Fabien Potencier, is responsible for publicly appointing
five (5) key players of the initiative to provide guidance and drive it forward,
but also retains the right to revoke any of the key players at any time. These
guiding key players should:

* Be committed to the initiative's cause and have joined because they want to
  help the initiative to deliver its purpose most effectively for the
  community's benefit.
* Recognize that meeting the initiative's purpose is an ongoing effort.
* Be committed to good governance and want to contribute to the initiative's
  continued improvement.

Veto
~~~~

The project leader (Fabien Potencier) will have the right to veto any actionable
item, regardless of the vote of the initiative's key players. The project leader
may, at their discretion, also appoint other people from among the initiative's
key players to also have the right to veto - in such a case these people are
expected to use appropriate judgement to know when to use a "no" vote or a veto.
Any single veto will reject an actionable item.

The purpose of having members with the right to veto is to prevent a "people's
majority" from overruling the core interests of the Symfony project. This will
encourage communication between proposing members, the initiative's key players
and the Core Team to create realistic proposals, and in return any veto will
come with a full explanation (not just a justification).

Advice Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a proposal on an actionable item is ready to be decided on, insight from
the community (advice, general consensus, or non-binding poll) should be
requested from the wider community - this will aim to include both those who
will be meaningfully affected and those with meaningful expertise in the matter
at hand.
This feedback will enable the key players to have the confidence to vote for the
best possible decision according to the information they have available, knowing
that the responsibility they accept for said vote is justified.

Voting
~~~~~~

Key players have the right to vote on proposals for actionable items.
The quorum of "yes" or "no" votes required for a decision to be considered valid
is at least 75% of active, appointed key players - to abstain from voting means
that vote will not be counted towards the quorum.
For an actionable item to pass, approval from greater than 50% of the voting key
players is required. Use or management of finances/donations require at least a
two-thirds majority to pass.

Guidance Principles
-------------------

Purpose
~~~~~~~

The initiative should be led by an effective team of key players that provide
strategic guidance in line with the initiative's aims and values, including a
shared understanding with fellow key players to ensure that these are being
delivered effectively and sustainably.

Integrity
~~~~~~~~~

Key players should act with integrity: adopting values which help achieve the
initiative's purposes, even where difficult or unpopular decisions are required.
Key players should undertake their duties, aware of the importance of confidence
and trust in the initiative from the wider community, and ultimately
acknowledges shared responsibility for the reputation of the Symfony project
like the Core Team.

Decision-making Effectiveness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key players should work as an effective team, using the appropriate balance of
skills, experience, backgrounds and knowledge to make sure its decision-making
processes are informed and equitable. Risk assessment and management systems
should be set up and monitored.

Openness and Accountability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behaviour and conduct of the initiative's key players sets the tone for the
rest of the community. Key players should lead by example to create a culture
that enables members to feel it is safe to suggest, question and challenge -
rather than avoid - difficult ideas and topics. Key players guide the initiative
in being transparent, accountable and open.

Adaptability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The initiative should establish processes that do not require any one person to
hold specific positions while being adaptable to accommodate unforeseen needs of
the community, especially as membership and involvement grows over time (changes
to key player appointment will have to be approved by the current system, which
is Fabien Potencier).
