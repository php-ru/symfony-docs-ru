How to Override any Part of a Bundle
====================================

This document is a quick reference for how to override different parts of
third-party bundles without using :doc:`/bundles/inheritance`, which is
deprecated since Symfony 3.4.

.. tip::

    The bundle overriding mechanism means that you cannot use physical paths to
    refer to bundle's resources (e.g. ``__DIR__/config/services.xml``). Always
    use logical paths in your bundles (e.g. ``@AppBundle/Resources/config/services.xml``)
    and call the :ref:`locateResource() method <http-kernel-resource-locator>`
    to turn them into physical paths when needed.

Templates
---------

See :doc:`/templating/overriding`.

Routing
-------

Routing is never automatically imported in Symfony. If you want to include
the routes from any bundle, then they must be manually imported from somewhere
in your application (e.g. ``app/config/routing.yml``).

The easiest way to "override" a bundle's routing is to never import it at
all. Instead of importing a third-party bundle's routing, simply copy
that routing file into your application, modify it, and import it instead.

Controllers
-----------

If the controller is a service, see the next section on how to override it.
Otherwise, define a new route + controller with the same path associated to the
controller you want to override (and make sure that the new route is loaded
before the bundle one).

Services & Configuration
------------------------

If you want to modify the services created by a bundle, you can use
:doc:`service decoration </service_container/service_decoration>`.

If you want to do more advanced manipulations, like removing services created by
other bundles, you must work with :doc:`service definitions </service_container/definitions>`
inside a :doc:`compiler pass </service_container/compiler_passes>`.

Entities & Entity Mapping
-------------------------

If a bundle defines its entity mapping in configuration files instead of
annotations, you can override them as any other regular bundle configuration
file. The only caveat is that you must override all those mapping configuration
files and not just the ones you actually want to override.

If a bundle provides a mapped superclass (such as the ``User`` entity in the
FOSUserBundle) you can override its attributes and associations. Learn more
about this feature and its limitations in `the Doctrine documentation`_.

Forms
-----

Existing form types can be modified defining
:doc:`form type extensions </form/create_form_type_extension>`.

.. _override-validation:

Validation Metadata
-------------------

Symfony loads all validation configuration files from every bundle and
combines them into one validation metadata tree. This means you are able to
add new constraints to a property, but you cannot override them.

To overcome this, the 3rd party bundle needs to have configuration for
:doc:`validation groups </validation/groups>`. For instance, the FOSUserBundle
has this configuration. To create your own validation, add the constraints
to a new validation group:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # src/Acme/UserBundle/Resources/config/validation.yml
        FOS\UserBundle\Model\User:
            properties:
                plainPassword:
                    - NotBlank:
                        groups: [AcmeValidation]
                    - Length:
                        min: 6
                        minMessage: fos_user.password.short
                        groups: [AcmeValidation]

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- src/Acme/UserBundle/Resources/config/validation.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <constraint-mapping xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/constraint-mapping"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/constraint-mapping
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/constraint-mapping/constraint-mapping-1.0.xsd">

            <class name="FOS\UserBundle\Model\User">
                <property name="plainPassword">
                    <constraint name="NotBlank">
                        <option name="groups">
                            <value>AcmeValidation</value>
                        </option>
                    </constraint>

                    <constraint name="Length">
                        <option name="min">6</option>
                        <option name="minMessage">fos_user.password.short</option>
                        <option name="groups">
                            <value>AcmeValidation</value>
                        </option>
                    </constraint>
                </property>
            </class>
        </constraint-mapping>

Now, update the FOSUserBundle configuration, so it uses your validation groups
instead of the original ones.

.. _override-translations:

Translations
------------

Translations are not related to bundles, but to domains. That means that you
can override the translations from any translation file, as long as it is in
:ref:`the correct domain <using-message-domains>`.
